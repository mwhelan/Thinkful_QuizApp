# Thinkful Quiz app

A quiz app that walks users through a set of questions and lets them know which questions they’ve answered correctly and incorrectly. 

The minimum requirements are as follows:

- The app must lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one.
- Users should be able to to input their answer to each question, with radio buttons or some other appropriate interface.
- When the user answers the last question, the app should show his or her overall score.
- Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll probably want to store your list of questions in an array.

If you are feeling particularly ambitious, consider implementing the following features:

- Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5")
- Let the user know their score so far
- 
- Let the user know if their previous response was correct
